# Cache Memory Simulator

The aim of this project is to simulate the behaviour of a cache memory that implements [set associative mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_placement_policies) as cache placement policy and [least recently used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies) (LRU) as replacement policy. Regarding memory writing, the strategy used was [write back](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-through-and-write-back-in-cache/).
This project was developed as final assignment for Computer Organization class taught by [lcaimi](https://github.com/lcaimi) in the [Computer Science course at UFFS](https://cc.uffs.edu.br/).
